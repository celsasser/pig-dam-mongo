# Pig DAM: Mongo Server

## Overview

We call him a server and he is but it's all MongoDB. We stick him in a container and let him do the things that need he needs to do to get things done.

And what is that?

It's to store project information. That's it. We use the FS to store DAM elements.

## TODO
Is MongoDB the best choice?  We like the flexibility of document storage.
